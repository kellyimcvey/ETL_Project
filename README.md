For our ETL project we will be collecting stock market data from the S&P for the last 5 years using Kaggle, along with consumer confidence index data from OECD. They come in the form of CSV files, and will be joined by date. Since the consumer confidence data ia based on quarter averages, we will need to find the averages for all 500 companies over the same time period.
